# Advent of Code - 2022 

I'm trying to use this event to learn Clojure and Go, prioritizing Clojure. I can hopefully do these in Python as well. I had to start with Python and kind of convert the solution to Clojure on day 1. We'll see how it goes.

1. Python > Clojure > Go
1. Clojure > Go
1. Clojure > Go
1. Clojure
1. Clojure
1. Clojure
